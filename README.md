we are implementing these three task using python library

1. how to separate audio and video from news video
2. how to convert audio speech into text(Speech Recognition )
3. how to fetch entities from text(Named Entitiy Recognition)



Fetch entities from text:

Named entity recognition (NER) is probably the first step towards information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.


We can build named entity recognizer with NLTK and SpaCy, to identify the names of things, such as persons, organizations, or locations in the raw text.



NER with spaCy

spaCy is regarded as the fastest NLP framework in Python, with single optimized functions for each of the NLP tasks it implements. Being easy to learn and use, one can easily perform simple tasks using a few lines of code.
